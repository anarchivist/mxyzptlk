# Mxyzpltk 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anarchivist/mxyzptlk.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/anarchivist/mxyzptlk)

Mxyzpltk is a fork of the [Pixyll](http://www.pixyll.com) theme for Jekyll originally by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com). Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

For more details, see the [Pixyll README](README.pixyll.md).

Development happens on the `develop` branch; `master` is slowly but eventually synced to the Pixyll upstream master.
